To the members of the recruitment team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,

During my time at Washington University in St. Louis, I have enjoyed studying a wide variety of disciplines: From learning about cutting-edge research in modeling human behavior in my economics and computer science major, to exploring social networks in sociology, and pondering metaphysical and ethical questions in a recent philosophy course, I have discovered a common thread throughout my academic interests. They all originate from a deep curiosity about human behavior and what drives it. This appetite for digging deeper has resulted in my decision to pursue a PhD in Economics. Prior to obtaining my PhD, however, I hope to peruse a temporary research position to solidify my fields of interests and further develop my research capabilities in preparation for my dissertation. I find the opportunity to work on behavioral economic research in the Research Department particularly compelling, though the prospect of working with leading economic researchers in any field excites me immensely and would help me round out my research skillset in preparation for my PhD.

Through academic coursework and internship experience, I have developed a strong quantitative background. For example, the foundation in Python I developed while learning the basics of artificial intelligence prepared me to later perform extensive data analytics last summer for a capstone research project in which I automated part of my employer’s analytical process to save around 20 hours of work per analysis. Alternatively, I developed a deep understanding of MATLAB in my computational macroeconomics course, where we solved different growth models (NGM, Galor-Weil, and Lifecycle Model) using dynamic optimization. Finally, in my most recent statistics course, I developed a strong foundation in R.

While my economic research to date has been less formal, I believe I still have the necessary skill set to work as a research assistant on your team. For example, I performed a robust econometric analysis of trading card markets for my econometrics course for a final paper. In another paper in my course in Behavioral Economics, I designed an experiment with a group of my peers to assess hoarding behavior. Finally, I have recently completed a theoretical research paper in social computing, where I am investigated the impact of the inclusion of temporal worker accuracy data into label aggregation algorithms, ultimately enhancing the ground truth prediction accuracy of leading algorithms.

I look forward to hearing back soon and discussing how I might contribute to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s extensive body of research.

Best regards,

Calvin Isley
","To the esteemed members of the recruitment team at a prominent financial institution,

During my academic journey at a university in a major city, I have delved into a diverse range of subjects: exploring advanced research in understanding human behavior in my combined economics and technology studies, investigating social connections in sociology, and contemplating deep questions in a recent philosophy class. These diverse academic pursuits all stem from a profound interest in unraveling the complexities of human behavior and its motivations. This keen curiosity has led me to aspire to pursue further studies in Economics. Before embarking on a doctoral program, I am eager to engage in a temporary research role to refine my areas of focus and enhance my research skills in preparation for advanced studies. The opportunity to contribute to behavioral economic research within the Research Department is particularly appealing, as collaborating with esteemed researchers in various economic fields would be instrumental in honing my research abilities for my future academic endeavors.

Through my academic coursework and professional experiences, I have cultivated a robust quantitative skill set. For instance, my proficiency in a programming language acquired while exploring artificial intelligence concepts enabled me to conduct extensive data analysis for a significant research project last year, streamlining analytical processes and significantly increasing efficiency. Additionally, I gained expertise in another programming tool during a computational economics course, where I tackled various economic models using sophisticated optimization techniques. Moreover, a recent statistics course enhanced my proficiency in statistical analysis using a popular software tool.

While my previous economic research experiences have been diverse, I am confident in my ability to excel as a research assistant. For instance, I undertook a comprehensive econometric analysis of unique markets for a final project, showcasing my analytical abilities. In another project focusing on Behavioral Economics, I collaborated with peers to design an experiment examining specific behaviors. Furthermore, I recently completed a theoretical research project in a technology-related field, investigating the impact of certain data on algorithm accuracy, which contributed to enhancing prediction outcomes.

I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to your institution’s esteemed research endeavors and eagerly await the opportunity to explore potential collaborations.

Warm regards,
