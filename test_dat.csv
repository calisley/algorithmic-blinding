To the members of the recruitment team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,

During my time at Washington University in St. Louis, I have enjoyed studying a wide variety of disciplines: From learning about cutting-edge research in modeling human behavior in my economics and computer science major, to exploring social networks in sociology, and pondering metaphysical and ethical questions in a recent philosophy course, I have discovered a common thread throughout my academic interests. They all originate from a deep curiosity about human behavior and what drives it. This appetite for digging deeper has resulted in my decision to pursue a PhD in Economics. Prior to obtaining my PhD, however, I hope to peruse a temporary research position to solidify my fields of interests and further develop my research capabilities in preparation for my dissertation. I find the opportunity to work on behavioral economic research in the Research Department particularly compelling, though the prospect of working with leading economic researchers in any field excites me immensely and would help me round out my research skillset in preparation for my PhD.

Through academic coursework and internship experience, I have developed a strong quantitative background. For example, the foundation in Python I developed while learning the basics of artificial intelligence prepared me to later perform extensive data analytics last summer for a capstone research project in which I automated part of my employer’s analytical process to save around 20 hours of work per analysis. Alternatively, I developed a deep understanding of MATLAB in my computational macroeconomics course, where we solved different growth models (NGM, Galor-Weil, and Lifecycle Model) using dynamic optimization. Finally, in my most recent statistics course, I developed a strong foundation in R.

While my economic research to date has been less formal, I believe I still have the necessary skill set to work as a research assistant on your team. For example, I performed a robust econometric analysis of trading card markets for my econometrics course for a final paper. In another paper in my course in Behavioral Economics, I designed an experiment with a group of my peers to assess hoarding behavior. Finally, I have recently completed a theoretical research paper in social computing, where I am investigated the impact of the inclusion of temporal worker accuracy data into label aggregation algorithms, ultimately enhancing the ground truth prediction accuracy of leading algorithms.

I look forward to hearing back soon and discussing how I might contribute to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s extensive body of research.

Best regards,

Calvin Isley

}","The transforming agent's changes have significantly altered the original text in several ways:

1. The transforming agent removed specific details such as the applicant's majors (economics and computer science), specific courses (computational macroeconomics, statistics), and project details (trading card markets analysis, hoarding behavior experiment, social computing research paper). These details are important as they showcase the applicant's academic background and experience, which are relevant for the position applied for.

2. The transforming agent simplified and generalized the language used in the original text. For example, ""extensive data analytics"" was changed to just ""data analytics,"" and ""robust econometric analysis"" was changed to just ""econometric analysis."" This simplification diminishes the depth and impact of the applicant's experiences and accomplishments.

3. The transforming agent made vague statements such as replacing ""performance of extensive data analytics"" with ""perform extensive data analytics,"" which removes the clarity and impact of the original statement.

Overall, the transforming agent's changes have resulted in a loss of specificity, depth, and impact in the text, which are essential for conveying the applicant's qualifications effectively.
