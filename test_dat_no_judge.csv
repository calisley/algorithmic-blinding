To the members of the recruitment team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,

During my time at Washington University in St. Louis, I have enjoyed studying a wide variety of disciplines: From learning about cutting-edge research in modeling human behavior in my economics and computer science major, to exploring social networks in sociology, and pondering metaphysical and ethical questions in a recent philosophy course, I have discovered a common thread throughout my academic interests. They all originate from a deep curiosity about human behavior and what drives it. This appetite for digging deeper has resulted in my decision to pursue a PhD in Economics. Prior to obtaining my PhD, however, I hope to peruse a temporary research position to solidify my fields of interests and further develop my research capabilities in preparation for my dissertation. I find the opportunity to work on behavioral economic research in the Research Department particularly compelling, though the prospect of working with leading economic researchers in any field excites me immensely and would help me round out my research skillset in preparation for my PhD.

Through academic coursework and internship experience, I have developed a strong quantitative background. For example, the foundation in Python I developed while learning the basics of artificial intelligence prepared me to later perform extensive data analytics last summer for a capstone research project in which I automated part of my employer’s analytical process to save around 20 hours of work per analysis. Alternatively, I developed a deep understanding of MATLAB in my computational macroeconomics course, where we solved different growth models (NGM, Galor-Weil, and Lifecycle Model) using dynamic optimization. Finally, in my most recent statistics course, I developed a strong foundation in R.

While my economic research to date has been less formal, I believe I still have the necessary skill set to work as a research assistant on your team. For example, I performed a robust econometric analysis of trading card markets for my econometrics course for a final paper. In another paper in my course in Behavioral Economics, I designed an experiment with a group of my peers to assess hoarding behavior. Finally, I have recently completed a theoretical research paper in social computing, where I am investigated the impact of the inclusion of temporal worker accuracy data into label aggregation algorithms, ultimately enhancing the ground truth prediction accuracy of leading algorithms.

I look forward to hearing back soon and discussing how I might contribute to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s extensive body of research.

Best regards,

Calvin Isley
","To the esteemed members of the recruitment team at a prestigious institution,

During my academic journey at a renowned university, I have delved into a diverse range of subjects. From engaging in forefront studies in understanding human actions within my educational pursuits of economics and computer science, to exploring societal connections in sociology, and contemplating existential and moral inquiries in a recent philosophical exploration, I have identified a unifying theme across my academic endeavors. They all stem from a profound inquisitiveness about human actions and motivators. This curiosity propels my aspiration to pursue advanced studies in Economics. Before embarking on the pursuit of a PhD, I aspire to engage in a temporary research role to refine my areas of interest and bolster my research capabilities in readiness for my dissertation. The opportunity to contribute to behavioral economic research in the Research Department is of particular interest. However, collaborating with leading researchers in any economic domain is equally appealing and promises to enhance my research acumen in preparation for my doctoral studies.

Through academic courses and practical experience, I have cultivated a robust quantitative foundation. For instance, mastering Python foray into artificial intelligence laid the groundwork for substantial data analysis during a significant research initiative last summer, where I automated portions of analytical processes, resulting in significant efficiency gains. Likewise, a comprehensive grasp of MATLAB from a computational macroeconomics class enabled me to tackle diverse growth models using dynamic optimization techniques. Additionally, a recent statistics course bolstered my proficiency in R programming.

Although my research in economics has taken an informal trajectory thus far, I am confident in my aptitude to contribute effectively as a research assistant. For instance, an intricate econometric examination of trading card markets for a final project in an econometrics class showcased my analytical abilities. In another instance, a collaborative experiment in Behavioral Economics delved into exploring hoarding tendencies. Furthermore, a theoretical study in social computing investigated the effects of incorporating temporal worker accuracy data into label aggregation algorithms, enhancing predictive accuracy.

I am eager to explore potential opportunities to collaborate and contribute to your esteemed institution's diverse research initiatives.

Warm regards,
