To the members of the recruitment team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,

During my time at Washington University in St. Louis, I have enjoyed studying a wide variety of disciplines: From learning about cutting-edge research in modeling human behavior in my economics and computer science major, to exploring social networks in sociology, and pondering metaphysical and ethical questions in a recent philosophy course, I have discovered a common thread throughout my academic interests. They all originate from a deep curiosity about human behavior and what drives it. This appetite for digging deeper has resulted in my decision to pursue a PhD in Economics. Prior to obtaining my PhD, however, I hope to peruse a temporary research position to solidify my fields of interests and further develop my research capabilities in preparation for my dissertation. I find the opportunity to work on behavioral economic research in the Research Department particularly compelling, though the prospect of working with leading economic researchers in any field excites me immensely and would help me round out my research skillset in preparation for my PhD.

Through academic coursework and internship experience, I have developed a strong quantitative background. For example, the foundation in Python I developed while learning the basics of artificial intelligence prepared me to later perform extensive data analytics last summer for a capstone research project in which I automated part of my employer’s analytical process to save around 20 hours of work per analysis. Alternatively, I developed a deep understanding of MATLAB in my computational macroeconomics course, where we solved different growth models (NGM, Galor-Weil, and Lifecycle Model) using dynamic optimization. Finally, in my most recent statistics course, I developed a strong foundation in R.

While my economic research to date has been less formal, I believe I still have the necessary skill set to work as a research assistant on your team. For example, I performed a robust econometric analysis of trading card markets for my econometrics course for a final paper. In another paper in my course in Behavioral Economics, I designed an experiment with a group of my peers to assess hoarding behavior. Finally, I have recently completed a theoretical research paper in social computing, where I am investigated the impact of the inclusion of temporal worker accuracy data into label aggregation algorithms, ultimately enhancing the ground truth prediction accuracy of leading algorithms.

I look forward to hearing back soon and discussing how I might contribute to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s extensive body of research.

Best regards,

Calvin Isley

During my time at a well-known university in a diverse city, I have enjoyed exploring a wide range of academic disciplines: From engaging with innovative research in modeling human behavior in my studies of economics and computer science, to investigating social networks in sociology, and contemplating metaphysical and ethical inquiries in a recent philosophy course, I have noticed a common theme across my academic pursuits. They are all rooted in a profound curiosity about human behavior and its motivations. This interest in delving deeper has led me to decide to pursue advanced studies in Economics. Before embarking on my doctoral studies, however, I am seeking a temporary research position to refine my areas of interest and enhance my research skills in preparation for my dissertation. The opportunity to contribute to behavioral economic research in the Research Department is particularly appealing to me, and collaborating with accomplished researchers in any economic field excites me and would enrich my research abilities in readiness for my PhD.

Through my academic coursework and internship experiences, I have cultivated a robust quantitative foundation. For instance, mastering Python for my studies in artificial intelligence equipped me to conduct extensive data analysis last summer for a significant research project, where I automated parts of the analytical process for efficiency gains. Likewise, gaining proficiency in MATLAB during my computational macroeconomics course enabled me to solve various growth models using dynamic optimization. And most recently, my statistics course provided me with a strong basis in R programming.

While my previous economic research experiences have been informal, I believe I possess the requisite skills to excel as a research assistant. For instance, for a final project in my econometrics course, I conducted a rigorous econometric analysis of trading card markets. In another project for my Behavioral Economics course, I collaborated with peers on an experiment exploring hoarding behavior. Additionally, I recently completed a theoretical research paper in social computing, investigating the impact of incorporating temporal worker accuracy data into label aggregation algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

I am eager to learn more about potential opportunities to contribute to your institution's valuable research endeavors.

Sincerely,
